- Apply common vector and matrix algebra operations like dot product, inverse, and determinants 
- Express certain types of matrix operations as linear transformations 
- Apply concepts of eigenvalues and eigenvectors to machine learning problems

#### Calculus for Machine Learning and Data Science
- Optimize different types of functions commonly used in machine learning
    -  Analytically optimize different types of functions commonly used in machine learning using properties of derivatives and gradients 
    - Approximately optimize different types of functions commonly used in machine learning using first-order (gradient descent) and second-order (Newtonâ€™s method) iterative methods
    - Visually interpret differentiation of different types of functions commonly used in machine learning
    
- Perform gradient descent in neural networks with different activation and cost functions 

#### Probability & Statistics for Machine Learning & Data Science
- Describe and quantify the uncertainty inherent in predictions made by machine learning models
    - using the concepts of probability, random variables, and probability distributions.
